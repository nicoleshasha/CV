#Nicole Shasha

My name is Nicole and I'm a full-stack junior developer. I'm looking for a role with an exciting, ethical company, doing something creative that helps and enhances people's lives. Before becoming a developer, I was a Masters student of archaeology and a barista. Programming, for me, is a perfect mix of creativity and science - through code I have the ability to create anything I want, while also gaining the satisfaction in building something that objectively works through logic.

#Skills

##Well developed analytical skills
After four years of university education I have well developed analytical and critical thinking skills. I found that archaeology spanned many disciplines, including philosophy, the sciences and technology. This mixture of scientific fact alongside in depth discussion of archaeological theory helped me to develop my analytical skills. I think that programming shares this need for analysis and discussion even when it seems like it is a scientific truth.  

##Team Worker
I'm very sociable and work well in a team. At university I was a committee member of the rowing society. Rowing is a very team orientated sport and requires good communication and cooperation. My time at Makers Academy has also helped me develop my social skills, by pair programming with a variety of people all with differing styles and personalities, and thereby adapting my work every day depending on who I was working with. I also enjoyed the fact that code can be written in multiple ways to do the same thing, and by working with others I gained a different viewpoint and understanding of ways of coding that I wouldnâ€™t have thought of myself.

##Creative
I'm a creative individual and love to make things. I like to paint, cross stitch and play music, and I have a passion for cookery and baking. I enjoy coding for the same reasons that I enjoy my creative hobbies - the satisfaction in creating something that is high quality and has the capacity to improve the lives of others. They both require a level of care and attentiveness, which, when I am engrossed by a project, I always seek to attain.

# Why I want to be a software developer

After graduating, I wanted to go into a career path that I found fulfilling.
I wanted a job that did something to help people, while also being interesting and exciting, while also being challenging in a satisfying way. While archaeology is fascinating, I thought it was limited in its ability to help people, create and develop new things. I have always loved video games, and for me they epitomise the mixture of creativity and logic that can be achieved with code. After graduating from Makers Academy I feel this even more. For me, the feeling when all of my tests are passing and my programme is doing what it's meant to is one of the most satisfying things I can imagine.
